 Here is my assessment2, about the maimai mascot Dila bear adjusting its size, position and orientation in the city scene. In this ui, I used blue, which is similar to the color of Dilla Bear, and the theme color of the scene was mainly gray, which is the same as that of the whole group. Clicking the start button to switch scenes will also play a Maimai-themed BGM.
